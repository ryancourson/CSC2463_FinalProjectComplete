# CSC2463_FinalProjectComplete
Arduino + p5 + Tone.js

**Project Outline**

For my final project, I felt that the part of the class I enjoyed the most was the graphics section so that is where I wanted to focus most of my efforts on this project. I chose to do an audio-visualizer using p5.js, Tone.js and externally, an Arduino Uno.
The project is inspired by a popular 80’s art style, Synthwave. I’ve always thought it was a great visual companion to music and I always wanted to recreate it. After learning a lot this semester on the graphics side, I knew I wanted to give it a try. I first created a mesh that could be manipulated to change the heights of each vertex (similar to pinching a blanket at one point and pulling up on it). Then, I decided I wanted the music not to be just in the background but interact with the graphics and become part of the experience. I used the amplitude of the soundwaves from a song I chose, in this case “Spirit in the Sky”, and used that to scale the amount that the mesh got changed. Lastly, I incorporated the Arduino component by using a potentiometer to control the max amplitudes of the peaks. There is also an indicator light on the breadboard to show when the music is currently playing.

**Future Development Plans**

Within the time I had to develop this project, the one thing I wish I had more time to do is make it more flexible in what the user can do with the software. I would like to have the user be able to search a small library of sounds, produce their own sounds with the visual reacting to it, and have much more control on the Arduino board. This could look like buttons to play musical notes, change different wavelength ranges that the amplitude is affected by with another potentiometer or something complete different as making it more presentable. I enjoyed this project a lot and hope that whoever uses it finds entertainment or inspiration to improve the work I did.
